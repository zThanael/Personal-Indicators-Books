<h1> Database </h1>
<p> 
Actually I created a <strong>postgreSQL</strong> database because I'm already used with it. But I needed a database that stay in cloud because availability, so I choose create my DataBase in <strong>Supabase</strong> a cloud service. 
</p>
<p>
My intent is use this database in all the parts of the Personal Indicators project. Now I just have datas about the part of Books in this project.
</p>

<p> <strong><i>
So to understand about the data structure of this project about books, I will put a image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
</i></strong></p>
